This is a test README file

It mostly just gives me something to commit to gitHub

That's all folks!

No then let's add this one from home.  Maybe I can push it upstream?

Now to try an edit

okay, back to the drawing board desktop

So now I'd change it here.  Just have to make sure changes don't conflict!
