This is a test README file

It mostly just gives me something to commit to gitHub

That's all folks!

No then let's add this one from home.  Maybe I can push it upstream?

Now to try an edit

but also add some stuff at middle

okay, back to the drawing board desktop

So now I'd change it here.  Just have to make sure changes don't conflict!  

well now change on desktop.  And push! 

with some laptop changes here.

what if I add stuff at end.
